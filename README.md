Ever since the days when we could only “tell stories” with text and the first/last frames, we’ve wanted to build a video model that truly understands what you’re trying to express. Today, it’s really here!

## 🤔 What is Seedance 2.0

Seedance 2.0 supports four input modalities—image, video, audio, and text—offering richer ways to express yourself and more controllable generation. You can use a single image to set the visual style, a video to specify a character’s actions and camera changes, and a few seconds of audio to establish rhythm and atmosphere… Combined with prompts, the creative process becomes more natural, more efficient, and more like being a real “director.”

• Image reference can accurately reproduce composition and character details  
• With reference video, it supports recreating cinematic language, complex action rhythms, and creative special effects  
• Video supports smooth extension and seamless continuation; it can generate continuous shots based on user prompts—not just generating, but also “keeping the camera rolling”  
• Editing capabilities have also been enhanced, supporting character replacement, deletion, and addition in existing videos
